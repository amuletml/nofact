======

nofact is a benchmark suite for the Amulet compiler. The name was
totally not stolen from GHC's nofib.

Current benchmarks:

 - *mandelbrot*: Computes and prints a 80x41 render of the Mandelbrot set to the
   standard output device.
 - *nbody*: Based on the [Computer Language Benchmarks Game benchmark of the
   same name][nbody]. Models the orbits of planets.
